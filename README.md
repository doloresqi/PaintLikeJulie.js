# PaintLikeJulie.js
PaintLikeJulie.js includes shapes/lines/colors that are common in Julie Mehretu's painting, so that the user is able to use the library and code a painting in her style. Meanwhile, the user is able to have fun exploring each function as well as different combination of shape and color.


Tips to Get Started
1. After downloading the library, you can first try creating some shapes and familiar yourself with different parameters.

e.g. Open the first link and try changing some parameters

2. Check out the color in the paintLikeJulie.js file and use it in your own parameters.

3. Randomize the position/size/rotate of shapes and see what will happen.
